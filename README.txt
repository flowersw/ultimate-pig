# Hello Clinton,
# I attempted to adapt your version of the pig game to this one. Probably
# because I haven't written good tests yet(I need more help with tests, suggested
#resources?)  I can't figure out why the program isn't
#  quite working. I do apologize for the incompletion, but I am learning a lot still
# and excited to put it into practice. I don't know that I'll get to the point where
# I can comfortably complete the assignments in the allotted time, but, hopefully.
# As always, let me know if you have feedback or would
#like to talk. I'd like to just go over what I need to finish this code up to run tomorrow,
#if that's cool. As far as the problem goes, I think the optimal number of rounds a
#simulator should bet is between 3 and 4 (probably 3, to be safe).

#Thanks,
#Will
